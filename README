This is your dotfiles repo
--------------------------

It will be cloned and updated automatically on servers when you log in. By
default you get a set of config files and bin scripts with some settings we
find useful at booking.com. Feel free to customize as you wish.

 $USER.git
  |
  +-- bin dir - used for scripts
  +-- dotfiles - this dir contains your actual . files, e.g. .bashrc
  +-- bit-bucket - this is where your original files are moved to is they exist

If you need special permissions to be retained to your files, use
  bin/record-permissions.sh
to update the permissions.dotfiles.  This file is used after each git
pull to adjust permissions accordingly.
